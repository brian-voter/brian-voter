### Welcome!

Hi! I'm a software engineer from a computer science background coupled with full stack engineering experience looking for new opportunities!

With over a decade of programming experience, I have a genuine passion for building tools that people find helpful to their everyday lives. I've worked on a wide variety of projects including learning management software, game server plugins, recipe apps, and language learning tools.

I'm also passionate about connecting with people and expanding my knowledge across domains. I have a proven ability to adapt to new environments, having spent 9 months at the Mandarin Training Center in Taiwan on a scholarship to polish my Chinese language skills. 

After returning to the US, I've fully turned my attention back to software engineering - I recently graduated from Rithm School, a full stack software engineering bootcamp. I also interned at Foqal where I contributed to a large production codebase.

Lately I've been most focused on TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL, React, HTML, and CSS, and I have significant previous experience with Java.

If you would like to chat about anything I've mentioned here or have any opportunities to share, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to connect with me at bvoter97@gmail.com.
